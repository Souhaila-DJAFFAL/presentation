# üîß Pre-Processing Fairness Toolkit 
> Addressing Bias at the Data Level

## üéØ Overview

The Pre-Processing Fairness Toolkit provides systematic methods to identify and remediate bias in training data before it reaches the model. This proactive approach addresses bias at its source, often providing the most effective and interpretable fairness interventions.

## üìã When to Use This Toolkit

- **Causal analysis reveals** data-level bias mechanisms
- **Significant representation disparities** across protected groups
- **Historical discrimination** embedded in training labels
- **Proxy variables** leaking protected attribute information
- Need for **interpretable fairness interventions**

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### Component 1: üîç Comprehensive Data Auditing Framework

#### Purpose
Systematically identify bias patterns in datasets to guide intervention selection. Think of this as a "bias diagnostic tool" that reveals hidden problems in your data.

#### Why Data Auditing Matters:
- **Hidden Bias Detection**: Reveals bias patterns not visible in basic statistics
- **Intervention Guidance**: Different bias types require different solutions
- **Legal/Compliance**: Documentation of bias assessment for regulatory purposes
- **Resource Prioritization**: Focus efforts on the most problematic areas

#### Auditing Checklist

##### 1.1 Representation Analysis
**What it does**: Examines whether different demographic groups are fairly represented in your dataset.

**Key Questions Answered**:
- Are some groups severely underrepresented?
- Does the data match real-world demographics?
- Which intersectional groups have insufficient data?

```python
def analyze_representation(data, protected_attrs, reference_population=None):
    """
    Comprehensive representation analysis across protected attributes
    
    This function performs three types of analysis:
    1. Basic Distribution: What percentage of each group is in the data?
    2. Bias Scoring: How much does data deviate from expected representation?
    3. Intersectional Analysis: Are combinations of attributes adequately represented?
    
    Example Output:
    - Gender: Male 65%, Female 35% (Expected: 50%/50% ‚Üí High bias)
    - Race: White 80%, Black 12%, Hispanic 8% (Expected: 60%/20%/20% ‚Üí Medium bias)
    - Intersectional: Black Women only 4% of dataset ‚Üí Very low representation
    """
    
    results = {}
    
    for attr in protected_attrs:
        # Step 1: Calculate actual distribution in your data
        attr_counts = data[attr].value_counts(normalize=True)
        results[attr] = {'distribution': attr_counts}
        
        # Step 2: Compare to reference population (if available)
        if reference_population and attr in reference_population:
            reference_dist = reference_population[attr]
            # Calculate how much your data deviates from expected representation
            bias_score = calculate_representation_bias(attr_counts, reference_dist)
            results[attr]['bias_score'] = bias_score
        
        # Step 3: Analyze intersectional representation
        if len(protected_attrs) > 1:
            # Look at combinations: Gender √ó Race, Age √ó Gender, etc.
            intersectional_dist = data.groupby(protected_attrs).size() / len(data)
            results['intersectional'] = intersectional_dist
    
    return results

def calculate_representation_bias(observed, expected):
    """
    Calculate bias score using Total Variation Distance
    
    Returns value between 0 (perfect match) and 1 (completely different)
    - 0.0-0.1: Low bias (acceptable)
    - 0.1-0.3: Medium bias (concerning)  
    - 0.3+: High bias (intervention required)
    """
    return sum(abs(observed - expected)) / 2  # Total variation distance
```

##### 1.2 Correlation Pattern Detection
**What it does**: Identifies features that might serve as "proxies" for protected attributes, potentially enabling indirect discrimination.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Proxy Variables**: Features correlated with protected attributes (e.g., ZIP code correlating with race)
- **Indirect Discrimination**: Using proxies to make decisions that have disparate impact
- **Legal Risk**: Using proxies can violate anti-discrimination laws even if unintentional

```python
def detect_proxy_variables(data, protected_attrs, threshold=0.3):
    """
    Identify features that may serve as proxies for protected attributes
    
    Why this matters:
    - Even if you remove gender from your model, using "interest in sports" 
      might still discriminate if it's highly correlated with gender
    - ZIP code might be a proxy for race due to residential segregation
    - Educational institution might correlate with socioeconomic background
    
    Method:
    1. For continuous features: Use Pearson correlation
    2. For categorical features: Use Cram√©r's V (measures association strength)
    3. Flag any feature with correlation above threshold
    """
    
    proxy_candidates = {}
    
    for attr in protected_attrs:
        correlations = {}
        
        # Analyze continuous features (income, age, credit score, etc.)
        numeric_features = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns
        for feature in numeric_features:
            if feature != attr:
                # Convert protected attribute to numeric for correlation calculation
                corr = abs(data[attr].astype('category').cat.codes.corr(data[feature]))
                if corr > threshold:
                    correlations[feature] = corr
        
        # Analyze categorical features (education, job title, ZIP code, etc.)
        categorical_features = data.select_dtypes(include=['object', 'category']).columns
        for feature in categorical_features:
            if feature != attr:
                # Use Cram√©r's V for categorical-categorical associations
                cramers_v = calculate_cramers_v(data[attr], data[feature])
                if cramers_v > threshold:
                    correlations[feature] = cramers_v
        
        proxy_candidates[attr] = correlations
    
    return proxy_candidates

def calculate_cramers_v(x, y):
    """
    Calculate Cram√©r's V statistic for measuring association between categorical variables
    
    Returns value between 0 (no association) and 1 (perfect association)
    - Cram√©r's V > 0.5: Strong association (likely proxy)
    - Cram√©r's V 0.3-0.5: Moderate association (investigate further)
    - Cram√©r's V < 0.3: Weak association (probably safe)
    
    Example: Cram√©r's V between "Job Title" and "Gender" might be 0.7
    indicating that job titles strongly predict gender (potential bias source)
    """
    confusion_matrix = pd.crosstab(x, y)
    chi2 = stats.chi2_contingency(confusion_matrix)[0]
    n = confusion_matrix.sum().sum()
    phi2 = chi2 / n
    r, k = confusion_matrix.shape
    phi2corr = max(0, phi2 - ((k-1)*(r-1))/(n-1))
    rcorr = r - ((r-1)**2)/(n-1)
    kcorr = k - ((k-1)**2)/(n-1)
    return np.sqrt(phi2corr / min((kcorr-1), (rcorr-1)))
```

##### 1.3 Label Quality Assessment
**What it does**: Identifies potential bias in the target labels themselves, which is often the most serious form of bias.

**Common Sources of Label Bias**:
- **Historical Discrimination**: Past biased decisions baked into training labels
- **Measurement Bias**: Different quality of data collection across groups
- **Confirmation Bias**: Human labelers bringing unconscious biases

```python
def assess_label_bias(data, outcome_col, protected_attrs):
    """
    Assess potential bias in outcome labels
    
    This function performs two critical analyses:
    1. Crude Bias Detection: Simple outcome rate differences between groups
    2. Conditional Bias Analysis: Bias that remains after controlling for other factors
    
    Example Scenario:
    - Crude analysis shows women get loans 60% vs men 70% ‚Üí Potential bias
    - But controlling for income, credit score, etc., the gap becomes 68% vs 70% ‚Üí Less bias
    - The remaining 2% gap might indicate pure discrimination

        rate_disparity = group_rates.max() - group_rates.min()
        bias_indicators[f'{attr}_rate_disparity'] = rate_disparity
        
        # Interpretation guide:
        # 0-0.05 (0-5%): Low disparity, probably acceptable
        # 0.05-0.1 (5-10%): Moderate disparity, investigate further  
        # 0.1+ (10%+): High disparity, likely bias present
    
    # Step 2: Conditional bias analysis - control for legitimate factors
    feature_cols = [col for col in data.columns if col not in protected_attrs + [outcome_col]]
    
    for attr in protected_attrs:
        # Use logistic regression to control for other factors
        # This estimates bias that can't be explained by legitimate factors
        X = pd.get_dummies(data[feature_cols + [attr]])
        y = data[outcome_col]
        
        model = LogisticRegression()
        model.fit(X, y)
        
        # Extract coefficient for protected attribute
        # Positive = favors this group, Negative = discriminates against this group
        attr_coef = model.coef_[0][X.columns.str.contains(attr)]
        bias_indicators[f'{attr}_conditional_bias'] = attr_coef.mean()
    
    return bias_indicators
```

### Component 3: ‚öñÔ∏è Reweighting and Resampling Techniques

#### Purpose
**The Problem**: Training datasets often don't represent the real world fairly. Some demographic groups are underrepresented, leading to models that work poorly for these groups.

**The Solution**: Adjust the importance of different training examples or generate additional examples to create balanced representation.

#### 3.1 Instance Weighting Methods

**How it works**: Instead of changing the data, we change how much each example "counts" during training.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Inverse Frequency Weighting**: Rare groups get higher weights
- **Demographic Parity Weighting**: Weights ensure equal positive prediction rates
- **Equal Opportunity Weighting**: Weights ensure equal true positive rates across groups

```python
class InstanceWeighting:
    """

#### 3.2 Advanced Resampling Strategies

**How it works**: Instead of changing weights, we actually generate new training examples or remove existing ones to achieve better balance.

**Key Advantages**:
- Works with any ML algorithm (doesn't require weight support)
- Can address complex intersectional imbalances
- Preserves original data distribution characteristics

### Component 4: üîÑ Feature Transformation Methods

#### Purpose
**The Problem**: Some features in your dataset indirectly encode information about protected attributes, enabling discrimination even when protected attributes are removed.

**Examples**:
- ZIP code correlating with race due to residential segregation
- Educational institution correlating with socioeconomic status
- Shopping preferences correlating with gender

**The Solution**: Transform features to remove protected information while preserving their predictive utility for legitimate purposes.

#### 4.1 Disparate Impact Removal

**How it works**: Mathematically removes disparate impact from features while preserving their rank order and predictive power.

**Key Innovation**: Uses statistical transformations to "repair" biased features rather than simply removing them.

```python
class DisparateImpactRemover:
    """
    Remove disparate impact from features while preserving rank order
    
    The Algorithm:
    1. For each feature, calculate group-specific distributions
    2. Map each group's distribution to the overall population distribution
    3. Apply repair level (0=no change, 1=full repair) to balance fairness vs utility
    
    Example:
    - Income feature shows: Men avg $80k, Women avg $60k
    - After repair: Both groups have same income distribution
    - But relative rankings within groups are preserved
    - High-earning women still rank high, low-earning men still rank low

        - 0.5: Moderate repair (50% bias reduction)

### Component 5: üé≠ Synthetic Data Generation

#### Purpose
**When to use**: When traditional pre-processing methods aren't sufficient, particularly when:
- Dataset is too small or too biased to fix with resampling
- Label bias is severe and can't be corrected
- Need to create datasets with specific fairness properties

**How it works**: Generate entirely new, synthetic data that has the statistical properties you want while maintaining realism.

### Component 6: üîó Integration and Validation

#### Purpose
**The Challenge**: Real-world bias often requires multiple interventions working together. We need to:
1. Orchestrate multiple pre-processing techniques
2. Validate that the combination is effective
3. Ensure interventions don't interfere with each other

**The Solution**: A unified pipeline that manages multiple interventions and validates the overall result.
